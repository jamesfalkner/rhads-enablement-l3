= AI Engineering: Using Pre-existent software templates to build an AI Agent with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite


== Objectives
In this lab, you will create an AI Agent using the pre-created component already Red Hat Developer Hub. This new application source code to the new resource to be part of the software development lifecycle.

== Scenario
Now, imagine for a moment that you are part of the Python AI Development team. The AI Team's responsibility is to build an AI agent using the provided tools by the AI Platform Engineering Team.

Let's get started.

== AI Agent Overview
An AI agent needs the following things:

* *Planning and Reasoning*: The AI agent uses an LLM for reasoning. For this module, we are using a Red Hat self-hosted module.
* *Tools and Actions*: An AI Engineer can build their own tools and integrations; however, there are many tools available that organizations can take advantage of. Additional integrations with custom systems are also possible.
* *Memory*, understanding context, such as short-term or long-term memory, is the ability to store data and learn more from it.
* *Input* could be a website or any device that provides input information to the agent. *Guardrails/Safety Layer: The rules that keep the agent's actions in check.

== Explore the AI Agent
Our AI Agent is a Search Agent that will search information on the Internet and specific websites, depending on the prompt send by the user. The agent will decide which tool to use to return the information you require.

== AI Agent Characteristics

* *Planning and Reasoning:* We are using a Red Hat self-hosted module for this module.
* *Tools and Actions:* This agent, is using the tools provided by *https://www.tavily.com[tavily^]*. Tavily provides tools, including Web Search to search information on the Internet, TavilyExtract to extract specific information on web pages, and TavilyCrawl to discover new pages and index their content, helping agents find content.
* *Memory:* Short memory is used for this AI agent.
* *Input:* This solution includes a website to interact with the agent.
* *Guardrails/Security:* Start with the prompt provided to the agent. And follows with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite security integrated, including image scanning, policy.  

== AI Agent Architecture
The following image describes the AI agent architecture, including the Red Hat products interacting directly with the application through the Software Development Lifecycle.

== AI Agent Use Cases

Many use cases that an AI Agent can fulfill, some of them are:

* Web Search
* Planning / Coordinator
* Fraud Prevention
* Events Manager
* Automated Code Generation & Testing
* Customer support
