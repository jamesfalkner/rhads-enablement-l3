= AI Platform Engineering: Using pre-existing software templates to provide the tools to build an AI Agent with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite


== Objectives
From the pre-existing software templates, you will bring a new resource in Red Hat Developer Hub, which will serve as a blank template for developers for the AI Engineers to build an AI agent. As part of the Platform Engineering team you will be setting up this resource with all kubernetes manifests including, trusted software supply chain, deployments and application promotion.
In the next lab, the AI Engineers will bring their application source code to the new resource to be part of the software development lifecycle.

== Scenario
You are part of the AI Platform Engineering team and are responsible for providing the tools and best practices with your organization's guidelines for the AI team to build an AI agent in OpenShift. 

Let's get started.


== Understanding the software templates

Software templates can build, deploy, and promote any application that can run on a container or Kubernetes component/configuration. Software templates ensure that development teams will start from the beginning with best practices and organization guidelines to ensure guardrails and compliance are in place before the application runs on the cluster.

== About pre-defined Software templates

Pre-defined software templates are offered with the RHADS installation and provide receipts that users can leverage to start bringing applications into OpenShift. The pre-defined Software Templates are built to give customers a starting point and a reference to make any application using Trusted Software Supply Chain (TSSC). They are not meant for production; customers can bring their own configurations on top of these templates following the documentation provided in the [product documentation]https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_developer_suite_-_software_supply_chain/latest/html/customizing_red_hat_advanced_developer_suite_-_software_supply_chain


== Create the component 
* Let's bring the pre-existing Software Template to Red Hat Developer Hub.

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python5.png[width=100%]

Next, you will explore the application source code.


*Congratulations!* You now have a resource available for the AI team to start building their application.

== Exploring the Software template

In this section, you will learn what was created and how to understand these configurations.

We now have two repositories available, both of which are needed to build and deploy the application:


* Source Repository: Contains pipelines that validate pull requests, ensuring image updates are safe before promoting applications to the next environment (e.g., from staging to production).

* GitOps Repository: represents the AI application, now with only a sample app. This is the repository where the AI Engineers will be working to include the AI Agent.

* Learn more about these templates at [Sample Pipelines]https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_developer_suite_-_software_supply_chain/latest/html/customizing_red_hat_advanced_developer_suite_-_software_supply_chain/about-sample-pipelines_default

== Adding more configurations

You have received some requests from the AI Engineering team:

- The application will use environment configurations to connect to an AI model and an API
- Integrate with Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces
- Create a webhook in GitLab to trigger Pipelines

As Platform Engineer you will need to update the software templates or components managing custom configurations. In this case, we are applying these configurations to the component created.
Let's work on these requests!


=== Integrating RH OpenShift Dev Spaces

In this template, you will include the integration with RH OpenShift Dev Spaces. The integration will be done by including a link in the component's overview UI. To achieve this, you need to include this information in the catalog-info.yaml file.

* Go to the GitLab source code repository:


On the same screen, click on *Source Repository* 

Or  use the following URL, link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/ai-agent[GitLab AI Agent,window='_blank'].

* Log in to GitLab using your credentials:

** Click on *Sign in*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-sign-in.png[width=100%]


** *Username*: {gitlab_user}
** *Password*: {gitlab_user_password}


* Click on the *catalog-info.yaml file*

* Click on *Edit*, then *Edit Single File*
image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-open.png[width=100%]

* Copy the following code:

+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
- url: https://devspaces.apps.{openshift_ingress}/dashboard/#https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_ingress}/rhdh/ai-agent
  title: RH OpenShift Dev Spaces
  icon: dashboard
  type: admin-dashboard
----


* Paste it into catalog in line 11.

* Your file should look like this:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/ai-agent-catalog-info.png[width=100%]

* Commit your changes:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-commit.png[width=60%]

* Verify the link was added to the component:


** Go back to {rhdh_url/catalog/default/component/ai-agent/}[Red Hat Developer Hub UI - AI Agent^]

** You should see an link similar like this:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-devspaces-click.png[width=100%]

*Note:* Do not click on the link. You will be working with RH OpenShift Dev Spaces later in the next lab.

=== Creating the webhook
Webhooks are not part of the pre-defined software templates; however, we need them to ensure pipelines will be triggered once the source is changed.
Now, we must create a webhook in the source code repository in GitLab.


* Click on Settings -> Webhooks

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook.png[width=100%]


* Copy the URL and past it on the *URL*

+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.{openshift_ingress}
----

* Check on the trigger option and select the following:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook-config.png[width=100%]

Next, on the same screen, you will test the webhook to ensure it works properly.

* Scroll down and *Click on the Add Webhook button*. 

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-add-webhook.png[width=100%]

=== Trigger the Pipeline

* On the webhook screen, click on *Test* and *Push events* 

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook-test.png[width=100%]

* Next, we'll see the pipeline being triggered.


=== Explore the Pipeline

** Go back to {rhdh_url/catalog/default/component/ai-agent/}[Red Hat Developer Hub UI - AI Agent^]

** Click on the *ci tab*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhads-tssc.png[width=100%]


The AI agent will be built with all security best practices and organization guardrails that are already in place before the development team starts building the application implementing Trusted Software Supply Chain thanks to Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite. As a best practices we want development teams to use the shift-left security approach on any development type. This approach applies to any kind of application.


To learn more about Trusted Software Supply Chain, ensure you review the modules Trusted Software Supply Chain. 


=== Adding environment variables

* Go to the GitLab gitops repository: link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/ai-agent-gitops/-/blob/main/components/ai-agent/base/deployment.yaml[GitLab AI Agent deployment.yaml,window='_blank'].

* Click on *Edit*, then *Edit Single File*
image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-open.png[width=100%]

* In line 52 paste the new source code to include integrations with LLM models including name, URL and API key. Additionally, the integration with Tavily API to be used as part of the AI Agent tools. 

+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
        - name: LLM_API_BASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: ai-agent-secrets
              key: LLM_API_BASE_URL
        - name: TAVILY_API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: ai-agent-secrets
              key: TAVILY_API_KEY
        - name: LLM_API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: ai-agent-secrets
              key: LLM_API_KEY

----
Your file should look like this, ensure the identation is correct:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/ai-agent-deployment.png[width=100%]

* Commit your changes:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-commit.png[width=60%]

*Note:* In the next lab, the developer will be creating the secret with the keys. This is not a recommended practice, but for the purpose of this lab and not share private keys on a public repository.

Great job! We have successfully built the tools for the AI Engineering team to start building their agent.
