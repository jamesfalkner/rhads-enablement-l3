= Building an AI Agent with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)

== Introduction

These labs will guide you through building and deploying a secure AI agent using the Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS). You will learn how to establish a strong framework for AI application development that incorporates security best practices from the start, all while using self-service tools on OpenShift.

== Objectives

This lab demonstrates how to use a pre-built software template in RHADS to deploy an AI Agent to OpenShift. This approach helps organizations ensure that developers have the tools and security standards they need right from the beginning. We will use the software templates already integrated into {product_rhdh_name}.

This guide is divided into two labs, each focusing on a different role; AI Platform Engineer and AI Engineer.

== AI Platform Engineer

As a member of the AI Platform Engineering team, you are responsible for providing the tools, templates, and security guidelines for the AI engineering team to build applications on OpenShift.

== AI Engineer

As a member of the AI engineering team, you are responsible for creating an AI agent that follows the guidelines and best practices established by the AI Platform Engineering team.
