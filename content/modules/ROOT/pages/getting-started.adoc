image::getting-started/rhads-architecture.png[alt="RHADS Architecture"]

The main components of RHADS are:

* **https://developers.redhat.com/products/developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)^]**: An **enterprise-grade, self-managed, and customizable internal developer portal** built on https://backstage.io[Backstage.io^]. It acts as a central portal for templates, documentation, and tools, reducing cognitive load and setup time. It streamlines development workflows with automated software templates and self-service capabilities. RHDH's plugin architecture allows for customized software templates and integrates with various tools and services.
* **https://developers.redhat.com/products/trusted-artifact-signer/overview[Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS)^]**: Provides a secure, transparent, and fully auditable signing and verification system. It ensures the integrity, authenticity, and provenance of software artifacts throughout the development and deployment lifecycle. RHTAS supports both keyless and key-based signing, simplifies signing using existing user identity (GitHub, Google, SSO), and maintains an immutable audit trail. It's an enterprise-ready deployment of the https://www.sigstore.dev[Sigstore project^]. RHTAS also extends its signing and verification capabilities to AI models, improving security during the AI model development lifecycle.
* **https://developers.redhat.com/products/trusted-profile-analyzer/overview[Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA)^]**: Provides platform engineers, developers, and security teams with **visibility and actionable insights into the risk profile** (vulnerabilities, licenses) of their software supply chain across the entire SDLC. It leverages Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management, open-source dependency risk analysis, and license tracking to detect vulnerabilities, malicious code, and compliance risks.

RHADS is **enhanced** by several free, complementary developer tools:

* https://podman-desktop.io/[Podman Desktop^]: This free, open-source tool provides a GUI for local container and Kubernetes management, helping developers build, run, and deploy applications on their desktop and reducing "works on my machine" issues. It supports air-gapped installation and includes an AI Lab extension for AI experimentation. While a community project, it receives Cooperative Community Support for Red Hat customers, including those on ARO and ROSA.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/overview[Red Hat Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)^]: This toolkit aids in modernizing legacy Java applications for container and cloud-native platforms, enabling assessment, refactoring, and migration with minimal disruption. It accelerates replatforming to OpenShift and will feature future AI integration with Developer Lightspeed for code generation to speed modernization based on static analysis.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-ide-extensions/overview[Red Hat IDE Plugins^]: These plugins facilitate local coding by integrating Red Hat ecosystem technologies directly into popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), and connect IDEs to OpenShift clusters for direct access to resources.

These tools extend the OpenShift experience to developer desktops and complement RHADS's features for increased productivity and security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

RHADS **complements OpenShift**:

*   It extends OpenShift's capabilities "to the left of the SDLC".
*   It integrates seamlessly with various supported tools and offerings, including **https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]**, **https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/pipelines[OpenShift Pipelines^]**, and **https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[OpenShift GitOps^]**. This allows development teams to:
** Code, build, test, and debug directly from their browser, mirroring production environments without requiring local setup.
** Release more quickly and test features, also enabling automated testing for earlier bug detection and improved Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR). Customers can also integrate existing CI/CD solutions into https://developers.redhat.com/products/developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub^].
*   It also complements https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS)^], which enforces security policies for containerized applications, ensuring only trusted artifacts run in the cluster.

The architecture aims to empower platform teams to define and curate trusted environments and tools, which developers then consume for accelerated, secure application delivery from development to production.

== Typical RHADS deployment

RHADS is designed with a modular approach that allows it to be integrated seamlessly with a variety of supported tools and existing platforms and systems, including those already in use by customers. The following diagram shows a typical RHADS deployment, the components involved, and how they interact with each other. There are many icons, most of which are 3rd-party products already in use by customers, demonstrating the flexibility and extensibility of RHADS.

image::getting-started/rhads-components.png[alt="RHADS Components"]

Here is a summary of the components and their roles based on the diagram above.

=== Developer Productivity & End-User Self-Service

==== IDE (Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, IntelliJ, VS Code, Podman Desktop)
Provides cloud-native development environments, enabling developers to code using familiar tools. These IDEs integrate with the Developer Portal and CI pipelines, allowing seamless transition from code to build. Podman Desktop is a lightweight, rootless, and Docker-compatible desktop GUI tool designed for developers to manage containers and Kubernetes locally, facilitating consistent development environments, experimentation with AI models via its AI Lab extension, and seamless integration with OpenShift.

==== Internal Developer Portal (Red Hat Developer Hub)
A centralized hub offering self-service templates, API documentation, component catalogs, and learning paths for developers. It also provides plugins to integrate with other tools and services including Red Hat OpenShift and a variety of 3rd party components. It connects developers with resources and tools across the development lifecycle, and enables team collaboration and knowledge sharing.

==== Version Control System (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
Houses both application and platform source code, including policies and configurations. Feeds into CI pipelines and GitOps workflows, ensuring traceable and automated deployments.

=== Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

==== CI/CD Tools (Tekton, GitLab Runners, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)
Automates building, testing, and integration of code changes. It pulls source code from version control and produces deployable artifacts. It also integrates with RHTAS to sign artifacts. RHADS is flexible enough to allow customers with other leading CI/CD solutions, such as Jenkins pipelines and GitHub Actions, to integrate them into Red Hat Developer Hub. This ensures that customers can continue to leverage their existing CI/CD investments.

==== Artifact Registry (Quay, JFrog, Nexus, etc.)
Stores and manages container images and other build artifacts such as SBOMs, VEX documents, and attestations. All artifacts are signed, scanned, and verified before deployment to ensure compliance and security.

==== Desired State
Defines the target application and platform configuration and image versions that the application platform should deploy and enforce. OpenShift GitOps (based on ArgoCD) then reconciles actual on-cluster state with this desired configuration to maintain consistency. 

=== Secure Supply Chain

==== Early Risk/Compliance Analysis (Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer)
Analyzes Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) and VEX documents to detect vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. Integrates with CI pipelines to inform developers of potential risks. It also integrates with OpenShift Dev Spaces to provide a unified view of the application's security posture directly from the IDE.

==== Artifact Signing & Verification (Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer)
Digitally signs and verifies artifacts, ensuring their integrity and provenance. Integrates with registries and GitOps tools to block untrusted content from being deployed.

==== Image/Deployment Scan (Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security)
Scans container images and runtime deployments for vulnerabilities and policy violations. Works with CI/CD pipelines and cluster environments to enforce security policies.

=== Application Platform

==== GitOps (OpenShift GitOps)
Automates application deployment and lifecycle management using Git repositories (the "Desired State") as the source of truth. Applies the desired state to clusters and continuously reconciles the actual on-cluster state with the desired state to maintain consistency.

==== Target Clusters (Red Hat OpenShift)
Kubernetes-based environments for running applications. Includes support for multi-cluster management through Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management.

==== Platform Services
Provides core operational capabilities including:
- Service Mesh
- Serverless
- Builds and Pipelines
- GitOps
- Tracing
- Observability
- Logging
- Cost Management

=== Cross-Cutting Concerns

==== Authentication / Authorization / Signing
Uses OpenID Connect providers like Red Hat build of https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak^] for secure identity and access management. Digital signing ensures trust across all pipeline stages. RHADS supports both keyless and key-based signing, using existing user identities like GitHub, Google, or SSO, and maintains an immutable audit trail for maximum transparency and trust.

==== Policy Enforcement
Policies are enforced from CI through runtime using signed artifacts, security scanning, and GitOps reconciliation. RHADS supports a variety of policies, including:

* Vulnerability scanning
* License compliance
* SBOM compliance
* Attestation verification
* Image scanning
