= Getting started with RHADS

== Why Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite?

Organizations developing software face a critical dual challenge: the urgent need to move fast by integrating AI and boosting developer productivity, coupled with the imperative to stay safe amidst rising software supply chain threats. Top software engineering priorities include integrating AI and increasing developer productivity, yet organizations struggle with long onboarding times, inconsistent development environments, and a lack of automation, which impede their ability to accelerate innovation and reduce the average 7-day software development cycle time. Simultaneously, despite open-source components comprising around 90% of modern applications, the ecosystem has seen a 156% year-on-year increase in malicious packages, leading to an estimated $60 billion in damages in 2025 and demanding effective risk remediation. This complex environment, where speed cannot compromise security, necessitates an integrated and comprehensive platform engineering solution like https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-developer-suite[Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS)] to balance these competing demands.

image::getting-started/rhads-architecture.png[alt="RHADS Architecture"]

The main components of RHADS are:

* **https://developers.redhat.com/products/developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)]**: An **enterprise-grade, self-managed, and customizable internal developer portal** built on https://backstage.io[Backstage.io]. It acts as a central portal for templates, documentation, and tools, reducing cognitive load and setup time. It streamlines development workflows with automated software templates and self-service capabilities. RHDH's plugin architecture allows for customized software templates and integrates with various tools and services.
* **https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/trusted-artifact-signer[Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (RHTAS)]**: Provides a secure, transparent, and fully auditable signing and verification system. It ensures the integrity, authenticity, and provenance of software artifacts throughout the development and deployment lifecycle. RHTAS supports both keyless and key-based signing, simplifies signing using existing user identity (GitHub, Google, SSO), and maintains an immutable audit trail. It's a production-ready deployment of the https://www.sigstore.dev[Sigstore project]. RHTAS also extends its signing and verification capabilities to AI models packaged in OCI format.
* **https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/trusted-profile-analyzer[Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA)]**: Provides platform engineers, developers, and security teams with **visibility and actionable insights into the risk profile** (vulnerabilities, licenses) of their software supply chain across the entire SDLC. It leverages Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management, open-source dependency risk analysis, and license tracking to detect vulnerabilities, malicious code, and compliance risks.

RHADS is **enhanced** by several free, complementary developer tools:

* https://podman-desktop.io/[Podman Desktop]: This free, open-source tool provides a GUI for local container and Kubernetes management, helping developers build, run, and deploy applications on their desktop and reducing "works on my machine" issues. It supports air-gapped installation and includes an AI Lab extension for AI experimentation. While a community project, it receives Cooperative Community Support for Red Hat customers, including those on ARO and ROSA.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/overview[Red Hat Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA)]: This toolkit aids in modernizing legacy Java applications for container and cloud-native platforms, enabling assessment, refactoring, and migration with minimal disruption. It accelerates replatforming to OpenShift and will feature future AI integration with Developer Lightspeed for code generation to speed modernization based on static analysis.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-ide-extensions/overview[Red Hat IDE Plugins]: These plugins facilitate local coding by integrating Red Hat ecosystem technologies directly into popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), and connect IDEs to OpenShift clusters for direct access to resources.

These tools extend the OpenShift experience to developer desktops and complement RHADS's features for increased productivity and security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

RHADS **complements OpenShift**:

*   It extends OpenShift's capabilities "to the left of the SDLC".
*   It integrates seamlessly with various supported tools and offerings, including **https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/pipelines[Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines]** and **https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[Red Hat OpenShift GitOps]**. This allows development teams to release more quickly and test features, also enabling automated testing for earlier bug detection and improved Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR). Customers can also integrate existing CI/CD solutions into https://developers.redhat.com/products/developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub].
*   It also complements https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS)], which enforces security policies for containerized applications, ensuring only trusted artifacts run in production.

The architecture aims to empower platform teams to define and curate trusted environments and tools, which developers then consume for accelerated, secure application delivery from development to production.

=== Typical RHADS deployment

RHADS is designed with a modular approach that allows it to be integrated seamlessly with a variety of supported tools and existing platforms and systems, including those already in use by customers. The following diagram shows a typical RHADS deployment, the components involved, and how they interact with each other.

image::getting-started/rhads-components.png[alt="RHADS Components"]

Here is a summary of the components and their roles based on the diagram above.

* **Developer Hub** - This component acts as the central portal for developers to log in, monitor applications, and access cluster resources and logs. Developer Hub provides a centralized portal for templates, documentation, and tools
* **Authentication Provider (OIDC, Keycloak, etc.)** - It handles user login and authentication for Developer Hub and is a key component in enabling keyless signing for software artifacts within RHTAS. The signature is tied to an OIDC Identity like Keycloak, Google, or GitHub
* **OpenShift Container Platform** - This platform hosts the running applications and is where resources are deployed. It is also where most components of RHADS are deployed, along with storage, networking, and compute resources.
* **OpenShift GitOps** - It monitors source code repositories and automatically deploys resources to the OpenShift cluster. GitOps plays a significant role in the deployment stage of the software development lifecycle within RHADS by enabling declarative continuous delivery
* **SCM (Source Code Management) (GitHub, GitLab, Azure Devops, etc.)** - This system stores application source code and is used to trigger CI pipelines.
* **CI (Continuous Integration) (OpenShift Pipelines, Jenkins, etc.)** - It builds application artifacts, pushes them to the registry, and triggers various security scans and validations. It also integrates with RHTAS to sign artifacts. RHADS is flexible enough to allow customers with other leading CI/CD solutions, such as Jenkins pipelines and GitHub Actions, to integrate them into Red Hat Developer Hub. This ensures that customers can continue to leverage their existing CI/CD investments
* **Image Registry (Quay, JFrog, etc.)** - It stores and serves the container images and artifacts created by the CI pipeline, including container images and their related signatures, attestations, and Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)
* **Advanced Cluster Security** - This component receives and analyzes the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from the CI pipeline. ACS plays a critical role in enforcing security policies for containerized applications and ensuring that only trusted, verified, and compliant artifacts run in production environments.
* **Trusted Artifact Signer** - It simplifies cryptographic signing and verification for software artifacts like container images, binaries, and documents during CI pipeline runs. It supports keyless and key-based signing, using existing user identities like GitHub, Google, or SSO, and maintains an immutable audit trail for maximum transparency and trust.
* **Trusted Profile Analyzer** - It receives and analyzes the Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), Vulnerability Exploitability Exchanges (VEX), and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) as part of the CI pipeline. It also integrates with OpenShift DevSpaces to provide a unified view of the application's security posture directly from the IDE.
