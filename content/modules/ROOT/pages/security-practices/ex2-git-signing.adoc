= Signing git commits

== Why sign code commits?

Signing git commits establishes **cryptographic proof of authorship and integrity** at the earliest point in the software supply chain. Each signed commit creates a verifiable link between code changes and the developer's identity, preventing impersonation and unauthorized code injection even if an attacker compromises repository credentials.

With **Trusted Artifact Signer / Sigstore**, this becomes particularly powerful because:

* Commits are tied to **verified OIDC identities** (like a GitHub or Google or internal SSO account) rather than (self-)managed keys that could get lost or be shared
* The signature and identity are recorded in an **immutable, transparent public log** (Rekor), providing auditability
* **Short-lived certificates** eliminate the security risks of long-term key management and revocation

The key benefits are:

. **Authenticity**: Verify that code truly came from who it claims to be from
. **Integrity**: Detect any tampering with commit contents or history
. **Non-repudiation**: Create an auditable trail that developers can use to prove innocence - or otherwise can't later deny
. **Trust propagation**: Downstream systems (CI/CD, artifact signing, deployment) can verify the entire chain from source to production
. **Incident response**: Quickly identify all code from a compromised account

In an end-to-end secured supply chain, signed commits form a **root of trust** — without them, security controls have an unverified foundation.

=== Why Access Controls Aren't Enough

*Why not simply lock down access to the git repository?*

Access controls are necessary but *not sufficient* for several critical reasons:

==== *Access Controls Don't Prevent Identity Spoofing*

Git's author field is just *unverified metadata*. Anyone with write access can commit as anyone else:

[source,bash]
----
git config user.name "Linus Torvalds"
git config user.email "torvalds@linux-foundation.org"
# Now all commits appear to be from Linus
----

Access controls only verify you can _push_ — not that you are who you claim to be in the commit.

==== *Credentials Get Compromised*

* *Stolen tokens/passwords*: Phishing, malware, leaked credentials in logs
* *Compromised accounts*: Attackers gain legitimate access (SolarWinds, Codecov breaches)
* *Insider threats*: Malicious employees with proper access
* *Platform compromises*: GitHub/GitLab themselves could be breached

Access controls can't detect misuse of _legitimate_ credentials.

==== *No Chain of Custody After Code Leaves the Repo*

Once you clone/pull code:

* How do you know it wasn't tampered with in transit?
* How do you verify it in air-gapped or offline environments?
* Your CI/CD pipeline can't verify authenticity based on repository ACLs

Signatures travel with the code; access controls don't.

==== *Auditability and Non-Repudiation*

Access logs show who _could_ have pushed, not cryptographic proof of who _did_. With signed commits:

* Developers can prove legitimate behaviour - and can't deny authorship
* Code provenance for compliance can be proven
* Integrity of the entire history can be verified, even years later


====
*Bottom line*: Access controls are perimeter defense. Signatures are cryptographic proof that survives compromised accounts, insider threats, and platform breaches—protecting the entire supply chain, not just the repository boundary.

== Signing `git` commits

For interacting with `git` we're using the `gitsign` cli tool. However, to use it, we also need the "trust root" from the TUF endpoint (which is downloaded to the user home under `~/.sigstore` - also see the output from the `cosign initialize` command, which outputs the location of the local and remote trust root )

If you have already done it in the previous step, you can skip it, but we need to issue *`cosign initialize`* at least once for the local environment to be initialized.

So, let's open our  https://admin-terminal-ttyd.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}["Podman Terminal"^,window="terminal"] again and 

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd /workspace
cosign initialize
----

In our preparations, we created an empty git repository that we will clone now and commit to it. We could do that from the GitLab UI (the repository is {gitlab_url}/l3-students/signing-and-verification[here^,window="gitlab"], sign in with `{gitlab_user}` and `{gitlab_user_password}`) - but since we have the terminal open, why not use it?

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd /workspace
git clone {gitlab_url}/l3-students/signing-and-verification.git
cd signing-and-verification
git switch --create main
touch README.md
git add README.md
git status 
---- 

[source,console]
----

----

Before we actually commit, let's quickly review our git environment

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
git config --global --list
---- 


[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
...
commit.gpgsign=true
tag.gpgsign=true
gpg.x509.program=gitsign
gpg.format=x509
...
----

This section tells `git` to use `gpg`-style signing (similar to the "traditional" private key based signing), the format (`x509`) and which program should provide the key/certificate. In our case, this is `gitsign` (that we pre-installed for your convenience).

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
...
gitsign.fulcio=https://fulcio-server-tssc-tas.apps.cluster-qkw52.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io
gitsign.issuer=https://sso.apps.cluster-qkw52.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/realms/trusted-artifact-signer
gitsign.rekor=https://rekor-server-tssc-tas.apps.cluster-qkw52.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io
gitsign.clientid=trusted-artifact-signer
...
----

This section tells `gitsign` where the various endpoints are, so it can request a signing certificate and where it can store the signing event metadata.

NOTE: We have chosen this path for convenience - with this configuration, git will automatically sign every commit (and tag) we create. *For sake of completeness* - we could also just commit without signing and then sign the commit later, using the `gitsign` binary directly, using the commit hash.

Now, let's commit this change:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
unset SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN #if still around from the previous exercise, gitsign would use it
git commit -m "added an empty README.MD"
----

Again, you'll be asked to copy the URL to a browser, login and then copy the result to the terminal again (if you're not asked to login, but directly see the code, that's because your Keycloak login session is still active. )

*If you'd run this from your workstation (as a regular developer would do), the browser window would open directly* - and if your session was still valid, you would just see a success message. 


IMPORTANT: Don't worry if "nothing happens" when you paste the code to your terminal session - gitsign doesn't echo the code. Just hit *return* after pasting. If it doesn't work, the commit won't happen and you can try again. 

[source,console]
----
podman-terminal:/workspace/signing-and-verification [+]$ unset SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN #if still around from the previous exercise, gitsign would use it

Now that we have signed the commit - we should also push it to our repo:

Use `{gitlab_user}` and `{gitlab_user_password}` for login to GitLab when pushing.

----

On GitLab, the repository will now look like this:

image::security-practices/gitlab-project-signature.png[]

GitLab recognises the signature, and we can check the details (we see the trust root / certificate issuer configuration that was added during TAS installation).

However, GitLab cannot _verify_ the signature as it doesn't support _sigstore_ signatures, only "traditional" key-pair based signatures. For it to verify, we would have to add the trust root public certificates.

We have those (they're actually downloaded from TAS each time you issue a `cosign initialize`) - *BUT* since we're signing with ephemeral signing certificates and GitLab doesn't know anything about Rekor / Transparency Logs - it would only verify the signature for 10mins - after that, the keys expire and it would again list the commit as "_unverified_".  


== Verifying git commits

At some point in our downstream tool chain, we'd want to verify that a commit we want to build is from a trustworthy source. 

In other words, we want to verify that 

. the commit has been signed and the signature is valid (*Integrity* - it hasn't been tampered with since its commit)
. who it came from (*Non-repudiation*, not just blind trust "_we'll trust everything from that repo, because the access controls will be good enough_")

Since our commit was signed with Trusted Artifact Signer and the OIDC identity of the signer is part of the certificate, we can do that.

To verify the commit signature, we'll use `gitsign verify` - however, the traditional git signature verification means also work (`git log --show-signature`, `git verify-commit`), but they don't verify the inclusion of the OIDC Identity and OIDC Issuer for that identity (called "certificate claims"), therefore are less secure and can't be used for verification of our second objective.

And we pushed as GitLab user `user1`

So, actually, *we can't trust the git author* - and the `user1` is just the access control to the repository, it doesn't follow the commit (the git author does, but is worthless in terms of security).
====


With `gitsign verify` we have the means to verify not only the signature (and this the commit's integrity) but also the certificate claims - who signed it and which system proved the identity.

So, depending on who you authored the signature with (when you followed the URL and copied the access code) - use this to verify both:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
gitsign verify --certificate-identity=user1@demo.redhat.com --certificate-oidc-issuer=$SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER HEAD
---- 

[source, console]
----
podman-terminal:/workspace/signing-and-verification (main)$ gitsign verify --certificate-identity=user1@demo.redhat.com --certificate-oidc-issuer=$SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER HEAD
tlog index: 0
gitsign: Signature made using certificate ID 0xb551af696f7e5460fb8c7a4201e9f83b42b79ec2 | CN=fulcio.hostname,O=TSSC
gitsign: Good signature from [user1@demo.redhat.com](https://sso.apps.cluster-v9q9c.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/realms/trusted-artifact-signer)
Validated Git signature: true
Validated Rekor entry: true
Validated Certificate claims: true
----

Or, if we want to be lenient - we can just verify the signature and its autenticity, as well as that it was signed by someone (could be anyone) who authenticated against any OIDC system in the `redhatworkshops.io` domain:


[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
gitsign verify --certificate-identity-regexp=.* --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp='.*\.redhatworkshops\.io(/.*)?$' HEAD
----

[source,console]
----
podman-terminal:/workspace/signing-and-verification (main)$ gitsign verify --certificate-identity-regexp=.* --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp='.*\.redhatworkshops\.io(/.*)?$' HEAD
tlog index: 0

Validated Git signature: true
Validated Rekor entry: true
Validated Certificate claims: true
----

[TIP]
====
You might have noticed that we are just verifying the HEAD signature (the last commit).

[source, console]
----
 gitsign verify --certificate-identity=user1@demo.redhat.com --certificate-oidc-issuer=$SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER HEAD
----

Depending on your requirements, you can iterate through the git log and verify each commit down to a desired depth, ensuring nothing unsigned was added after a secure baseline. Instead of `*HEAD*` we can use any git commit `sha`, like this:

[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

# Get all commit SHAs in reverse chronological order
commits=$(git rev-list --all)

# Counter for tracking progress
total=$(echo "$commits" | wc -l)
current=0

echo "Verifying $total commits..."
echo "---"

# Iterate through each commit
for commit in $commits; do
    current=$((current + 1))
    echo "[$current/$total] Verifying commit: $commit"
    
    # Run gitsign verify for this commit
    if gitsign verify --certificate-identity-regexp=.* --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp='.*\.redhatworkshops\.io(/.*)?$' "$commit"; then
        echo "✓ Commit $commit verified successfully"
    else
        echo "✗ Commit $commit verification FAILED"
    fi
    echo "---"
done

echo "Verification complete!"
